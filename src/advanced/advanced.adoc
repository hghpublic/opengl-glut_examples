This example shows how to use the GLU polygon tessellator to determine
the 2D boundary of OpenGL rendered objects. The program uses OpenGL's
feedback mechanim to capture transformed polygons and then feeds them to

GLU++_++TESS++_++BOUNDARY++_++ONLY mode.

This program demonstrates virtualization of OpenGL's lights. The idea is
that if an object is lit by many lights, it is computationally more
efficient to calculate the approximate lighting contribution of the
various lights per-object and only enable the "brightest" lights while
rendering the object. This also lets you render scenes with more lights
than the OpenGL implementation light (usually 8). Two approaches are
used: The "distance-based" approach only enables the 8 closest lights
based purely on distance. The "Lambertian-based" approach accounts for
diffuse lighting contributions and approximates the diffuse
contribution.
