Draw test patterns to help determine correct gamma value for a display.
When the intensities in the top row nearly match the intensities in the
bottom row you've found the right gamma value.

|image:./images/offset.jpg[./images/offset] |
Uses PolygonOffset to draw hidden-line images. PolygonOffset shifts the
z values of polygons an amount that is proportional to their slope in
screen z. This keeps the lines, which are drawn without displacement,
from interacting with their respective polygons, and thus eliminates
line dropouts. The left image shows an ordinary antialiased wireframe
image. The center image shows an antialiased hidden-line image without
PolygonOffset. The right image shows an antialiased hidden-line image
using PolygonOffset to reduce artifacts.

|image:./images/reflect.jpg[./images/reflect] |
Reflection demo. The basic steps are: 1. Render the reflective object (a
polygon) from the normal viewpoint, setting the stencil planes = 1. 2.
Render the scene from a special viewpoint: the viewpoint which is on the
opposite side of the reflective plane. Only draw where stencil = 1. This
draws the objects in the reflective surface. 3. Render the scene from
the original viewpoint. This draws the objects in the normal fashion.
Use blending when drawing the reflective, textured surface.

|image:./images/trdemo.jpg[./images/trdemo] |
Test/demonstration of tile rendering utility library. This library
allows one to render arbitrarily large images with OpenGL. The basic
idea is to break the image into tiles which are rendered one at a time.
The tiles are assembled together to form the final, large image. Tiles
can be of any size.
