Demonstrates the use of the extension EXT++_++abgr. The same image data
is used for both ABGR and RGBA formats in glDrawPixels and glTexImage2D.
The left side uses ABGR, the right side RGBA. The top polygon
demonstrates use of texture, and the bottom image is drawn with
glDrawPixels. Note that the textures are defined as 3 component, so the
alpha value is not used in applying the DECAL environment.

This program demonstrates when to issue lighting and transformation
commands to render a model with a light which is moved by a modeling
transformation (rotate or translate). The light position is reset after
the modeling transformation is called. The eye position does not change.
A sphere is drawn using a grey material characteristic. A single light
source illuminates the object. Interaction: pressing the left or middle
mouse button alters the modeling transformation (x rotation) by 30
degrees. The scene is then redrawn with the light in a new position.

This program demonstrates switching between single buffered and double
buffered windows when using GLUT. Use the pop-up menu to change the
buffering style used. On machine that split the screen's color
resolution in half when double buffering, you should notice better
coloration (less or no dithering) in single buffer mode (but flicker on
redraws, particularly when rotation is toggled on).

Very simple example of how to achieve reflections on a flat surface
using OpenGL blending. The example has a mode using OpenGL stenciling to
avoid drawing the reflection not on the top of the floor. Initially,
stenciling is not used so if you look (by holding down the left mouse
button and moving) at the dinosaur from "below" the floor, you'll see a
bogus dinosaur and appreciate how the basic technique works. Enable
stenciling with the popup menu and the bogus dinosaur goes away! Also,
notice that OpenGL lighting works correctly with reflections.
